I want it to be something between a sovial media site and a blog. I don't want it completely like tumblr. I don't want the
reblog feature because I want it to be completely original content. I want there to be a "share" feature and a "post" 
feature; as well as a "like" feature. There will be profiles and a photo/ video viewer. You can add other blogs with a 
blog search. Users will be able to choose a username.
